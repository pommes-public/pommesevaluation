# pommesevaluation
Evaluation routines for pommes model runs

## Usage

* Ensure necessary data inputs on your local machine:
  * prices from EPEX spot have to be stored under data/prices
  * model_inputs can be retrieved by pommesdata and copied into model_inputs folder
* Run scripts for either price validation, merit order plotting or dispatch validation (the latter is yet to come)
